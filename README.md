# FoodHub---University-Year-2-Project

FoodHub was a university project that attempts to tackle world hunger by using a donation website. The main premise was that food banks could create an accounts and advertise the food/drink that they lacked. Donators could then donate and would receive vouchers/discounts on stores in exchange.

FoodHub was created using Spring Boot and Microsoft SQL Server as a backend, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript as a frontend.
